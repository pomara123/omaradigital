**Project Overview:**  
This project involved leading a comprehensive evaluation, selection, and transition to a new IT Managed Service Provider (MSP). The effort focused on aligning technical capabilities, particularly cloud and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) engineering expertise, with business needs and budget constraints. Findings and recommendations were presented to executive leadership, and a structured transition plan was executed to ensure continuity of services with no disruption to ongoing operations.

Following the successful transition, the selected MSP published a public case study highlighting the engagement and outcomes.

## Objectives

1. Identify and document required IT and cloud capabilities needed to support the organization.
2. Evaluate MSP candidates against technical, operational, and financial criteria.
3. Estimate and validate budget ranges for managed services.
4. Present recommendations and trade-offs to executive leadership.
5. Select an MSP aligned with long-term technology strategy.
6. Transition services to the new partner with minimal operational risk.

## Background

The existing IT support model no longer met the organization’s growing technical needs, particularly around cloud infrastructure and GCP engineering. A new MSP partner was required to provide scalable expertise, improved service quality, and predictable costs while aligning with the company’s strategic direction.

## Problem

Selecting an MSP involved balancing technical depth, cloud capabilities, cost, and cultural fit. There was limited clarity around required skill sets, service scope, and budget expectations. Additionally, transitioning between providers carried the risk of service disruption if not carefully planned and executed.

## Features

1. **Capability & Skills Assessment**
   - Defined required MSP competencies, including GCP cloud engineering, infrastructure management, security, and operational support.
   - Aligned skill requirements with current and future business needs.

2. **Vendor Evaluation & Comparison**
   - Evaluated multiple MSP candidates across technical capabilities, service models, SLAs, and cost structures.
   - Conducted detailed comparisons to highlight strengths, risks, and gaps.

3. **Budget Estimation & Financial Analysis**
   - Developed estimated budget ranges for managed services.
   - Compared pricing models and identified cost drivers and trade-offs.

4. **Executive Proposal & Decision Support**
   - Prepared and presented recommendations to executive leadership.
   - Clearly articulated options, risks, and expected outcomes to support decision-making.

5. **Transition Planning & Execution**
   - Developed a structured transition plan from the existing provider to the selected MSP.
   - Coordinated knowledge transfer, access provisioning, and service handoff.
   - Ensured continuity of operations throughout the transition.

6. **Operational Stabilization**
   - Validated service delivery post-transition.
   - Established communication channels, escalation paths, and ongoing governance.

## Technology & Focus Areas

- Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Core Services: Infrastructure support, cloud engineering, security, operations
- Governance: SLAs, escalation procedures, service reviews
- Documentation: Capability assessments, vendor comparisons, executive presentations

## Outcome

A new IT MSP partner was successfully selected and onboarded, providing improved cloud engineering capabilities and operational support aligned with business needs. Executive leadership approved the recommendation based on clear technical and financial analysis. The transition to the new MSP was completed smoothly with no disruption to services, and the engagement was later documented in a public case study, reinforcing the success of the initiative.
