**Project Overview:**  
This project evaluated the current informatics landscape across research, biology, chemistry, proteomics, operations, and data science teams. The assessment identified process gaps, system limitations, data challenges, and opportunities to modernize the scientific digital ecosystem. The outcome provided a clear future state vision and a prioritized roadmap that strengthens data quality, improves workflow efficiency, and prepares the organization for increased AI and ML adoption.

## Objectives

1. Perform a cross functional analysis of scientific workflows, data sources, and system usage.  
2. Identify gaps in materials management, request management, data processing, analytics, asset management, and infrastructure.  
3. Establish a future state architecture that improves data integrity, scalability, and interoperability.  
4. Recommend actionable steps that align the organization with industry trends and modern informatics practices.

## Background

The organization relied on a mixture of spreadsheets, legacy processes, isolated systems, and ad hoc analysis tools. Assay tracking, compound management, proteomics workflows, and biological data handling varied across teams. Many groups generated or analyzed data on local computers, leading to inconsistencies and limited visibility. A centralized assessment was needed to clarify pain points and define an informatics strategy aligned with growing scientific demands.

## Problem

Teams required better systems for registration, sample tracking, request coordination, instrument data capture, analytics, and asset oversight. Data resided across CDD Vault, Egnyte, spreadsheets, local drives, and on-prem servers. Key limitations included lack of inventory tracking, no unified request management, inconsistent data normalization, limited cloud use, and fragmented ETL solutions. These gaps prevented scalable scientific operations and blocked future AI and ML initiatives.
